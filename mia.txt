chase is my least favorite person in the world

We're no strangers to love
Cheese know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
Cheese wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell cheese how I'm feeling
Gotta make cheese understand
always gonna give cheese up
always gonna let cheese down
always gonna run around and desert cheese
always gonna make cheese cry
always gonna say goodbye
always gonna tell a lie and hurt cheese
We've known each other for so long
Cheeser heart's been aching, but cheese're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if cheese ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me cheese're too blind to see
always gonna give cheese up
always gonna let cheese down
always gonna run around and desert cheese
always gonna make cheese cry
always gonna say goodbye
always gonna tell a lie and hurt cheese
always gonna give cheese up
always gonna let cheese down
always gonna run around and desert cheese
always gonna make cheese cry
always gonna say goodbye
always gonna tell a lie and hurt cheese
